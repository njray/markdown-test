# Mainframe workloads supported on Azure

Microsoft Azure provides a proven, highly available and scalable infrastructure for systems that currently run on mainframes. Some workloads can be migrated with relative ease. Other workloads that depend on CICS, IMS, and other legacy system software can be rehosted using partner solutions and migrated to Azure over time.

For a list of officially recognized partner solutions for mainframe emulation and services on Azure, refer to the [Azure Mainframe Migration center](https://azure.microsoft.com/migration/mainframe/).
