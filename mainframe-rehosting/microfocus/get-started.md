# Micro Focus dev/test environments on Azure

Getting started on Azure with a development and test environment is a great way to boost your modernization efforts. Mainframe applications that depend on legacy systems such as IBM CICS (Customer Information Control System) and IMS (Information Management System) can be rehosted on Azure using partner solutions.

Micro Focus has partnered with Microsoft to offer compelling mainframe migration and rehosting tools. You can run mainframe applications across development, testing, and production scenarios on Azure and the Microsoft Windows platform.

Micro Focus offers development rehosting and test rehosting solutions that extend existing COBOL and PL/I business applications to Azure.
