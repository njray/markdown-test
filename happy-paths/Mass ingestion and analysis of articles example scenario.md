# Mass ingestion and analysis of news feeds on Azure

This example scenario describes a pipeline for mass ingestion of electronic documents using public RSS news feeds. It then provides near-real-time analysis using Azure Cognitive Services to offer useful insights as the documents are placed in durable storage.

A generator is used to populate Azure Cosmos DB with RSS articles in multiple languages, and then trigger several actions. These actions demonstrate the use of available Cognitive Services, including text translation, facial recognition, and detecting sentiment.

This scenario is based on [English][english], [Russian][russian], and [German][german] news feeds, but you can easily extend it to other RSS feeds. For ease of deployment, the data collection, processing, and analysis are based entirely on Azure services.

## Relevant use cases

Other relevant use cases include:

* Translate any text to the language of choice.
* Find key phrases, entities, and user sentiment in digital content.
* Detect objects, text, and landmarks in images associated with a digital article.
* Detect people by their gender and age in any image associated with digital content.

## Architecture

Original
![Architecture of a machine learning model for training movie recommendations][architecture]

Number 2
![Architecture of a machine learning model for training movie recommendations][architecture2]

Number 3
![Architecture of a machine learning model for training movie recommendations][architecture3]

The data flows through the solution as follows:

1.  An RSS news feed acts as the generator that obtains data from a document or article. For example, with an article, data typically includes a title, a summary of the original body of the news item, and sometimes images

2.  A generator or ingestion process inserts the article and any associated images into an Azure Cosmos DB[Collection][collection].

3.  A notification triggers an Ingest function in Azure Functions that stores the image content, if any, in an Azure Storage account as blobs. The article is then passed to the next queue.

4.  A Translate function is triggered by the queue event. It uses the [Translate Text API][translate-text] of Azure Cognitive Services to detect the language, translate if necessary, and collect the sentiment, key phrases, and entities from the body and the title. Then it passes the article to the next queue.

5.  A Detect function is triggered. It uses the [Computer Vision][vision] service to detect objects, landmarks, and written words in the associated image, then passes the article to the next queue.

6.  A Face function is triggered. It uses the [Azure Face API][face] service to detect faces for gender and age in the associated image, then passes the article to the next queue.

7.  The Notify function is triggered. It load the processed records for the article and images and scans them for the particular content you want. If found, the content is flagged and a notification is sent to the system of your choice.

At each processing step, the function writes the results to Azure Cosmos DB. Ultimately, the data can be used as desired. For example, you can use it to enhance business processes, locate new customers, or identify customer satisfaction issues.

### Components 

The following list of Azure components are used in this example.

* [Azure Storage][storage]. Used to hold raw image and video files associated with an article. A secondary storage account is created with Azure App Service and is used to host the Azure Function code and logs.

* [Azure Cosmos DB][cosmos-db]. Used to hold article textual content and image and video tracking information. The results of the Cognitive Services steps are also stored here.

* [Azure Functions][functions]. Provides the function code used to respond to queue messages and transform the incoming content. [Azure App Service][aas] hosts the function code and processes the records serially. This scenario includes five functions: Ingest, Transform, Detect Object, Face, and Notify.

* [Azure Service Bus][service-bus]. Hosts the Azure Service Bus Queues used by the functions.

* [Azure Cognitive Services][acs]. Provides the AI for the pipeline based on implementations of the [Computer Vision][vision] service, [Face API][face], and [Translate Text][translate-text] machine translation service.

* [Azure Application Insights][aai]. Provides insights into the functionality of the Azure App Service.

### Alternatives

* Instead of using a pattern based on queue notification and Azure Functions, use another pattern for this data flow. For example, [Azure Service Bus Topics][topics] can used in a pattern that processes the various parts of the article in parallel as opposed to the serial processing done in this example. For more information, compare [queues and topics][queues-topics].

* Use [Azure Logic App][logic-app] to implement the function code and implement record-level locking such as [Redlock][redlock] (needed for parallel processing until Azure Cosmos DB supports [partial document updates][partial]). For more information, [compare Functions and Logic Apps][compare].

* Implement this architecture using customized AI components rather than existing Azure services. For example, extend the pipeline using a customized model that detects certain people in an image as opposed to the generic people count, gender and age data collected in this example. To use customized machine learning or AI models with this architecture, the models must be built as RESTful endpoints.

* Use a different input mechanism instead of RSS feeds. Use multiple generators or ingestion processes to feed Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Storage.

## Considerations

For simplicity, this example scenario uses only a few of the available APIs and services from Azure Cognitive Services. For example, text in images can be analyzed using the [Text Analytics API][text-analytics]. The target language in this scenario is assumed to be English, but you can
change the input to any [supported language][language] of your choice.

### Scalability

Function app scaling depends on the [hosting plan][plan] you use. This solution assumes a [Consumption plan][plan-c], in which compute power is automatically allocated to the functions when required. You pay only when your functions are running. Another option is to use an [Azure App Service][plan-aas] plan, which allow you to scale between tiers to allocate a different amount of resources.

With Azure Cosmos DB, the key is to distribute your workload roughly evenly among a sufficiently large number of [partition keys][keys]. There's no limit to the total amount of data that a container can store or to the total amount of
[throughput][throughput] that a container can support.

### Management and logging

This solution uses [Azure Application Insights][aai] to collect performance and logging information. An instance of Application Insights is created with the deployment in the same resource group as the other services needed for this deployment.

To view the logs generated by the solution:

1.  Go to [Azure Portal][portal] and navigate to the resource group created for the deployment.

2.  Click the **Application Insights** instance.

3.  On the **Application Insights** blade, navigate to **Investigate\\Search** and search the data.

### Security

Azure Cosmos DB uses a secured connection and key through the C\# SDK provided by Microsoft. There are no other externally facing surface areas. Learn more about security [best practices][db-practices] for Azure Cosmos DB.

## Pricing

The estimated daily cost to keep this deployment available is approximately \$20 U.S. with no data moving through the system.

Azure Cosmos DB is incredibly powerful but incurs the greatest [cost][db-cost] in this deployment. You can use another storage solution by refactoring the Azure Function code provided.

Pricing for Azure Functions varies depending on the [plan][function-plan] it runs in.

## Deploy the scenario

**Prerequisites**: You must have an existing Azure account. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account][free] before you begin.

All the code for this scenario is available in the [GitHub][github]. This repository contains the source code used to build the generator application that feeds the pipeline for this demo.

### Azure Cosmos DB considerations

The GitHub [readme][readme]discusses several required data formats.

The two core collections for the articles pipeline are Ingest and Processed. The design of the two are similar in that there are very few first-class members of the document but potentially many *properties* associated with the document depending on the type.

A third collection, Inspection, is also implemented. It simply records information about the processing of the original article and its children. Its table can be customized or removed depending on how the reader implements a notification schema for content of interest.

### Azure Functions considerations

Several application settings are required in the function app to ensure that the code runs correctly. Given the source code, the following values are required:

| **Key**                                | **Value**                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
